# Boston-House-Price-Prediction
The problem that we are going to solve here is that given a set of features that describe a house in Boston, our machine learning model must predict the house price. To train our machine learning model with boston housing data, we will be using scikit-learn’s boston dataset.

In this dataset, each row describes a boston town or suburb. There are 506 rows and 13 attributes (features) with a target column (price).
Given a list of attributes of the household, the goal is to predict the monetary value of any house located in Boston city. The features can be summarized as follows:

 CRIM: This is the per capita crime rate by town
 ZN: This is the proportion of residential land zoned for lots larger than 25,000 sq.ft.
 INDUS: This is the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
 CHAS: This is the Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
 NOX: This is the nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
 RM: This is the average number of rooms per dwelling
 AGE: This is the proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
 DIS: This is the weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
 RAD: This is the index of accessibility to radial highways
 TAX: This is the full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
 PTRATIO: This is the pupil-teacher ratio by town
 B: B =1000(BK — 0.63)², where BK is African American people proportion descent by town
 LSTAT: This is the percentage lower status of the population
 MEDV: This is the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s (Target Variable)
